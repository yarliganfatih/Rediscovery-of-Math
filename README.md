# Rediscovery of Math

# Numbers
Everything in mathematics is actually based on repetitive operations between 1 and 0. Just like the two sides of the coin, there are two numbers representing existence and non-existence, such as night and day, cold and hot.

## Addition and substraction

### Addition
Mathematics is the language of the universe. Let's take an example from nature.
- We don't have apples = 0 apples
- We have an apple = 1 apple
- We got 1 more apple from the tree. We need to define a concept for this apple group. We call this number 2.
- We bought 1 more apple, we said 3.
- 1 more apple, 1 more apple, 1 more apple... Our ancestors decided to advance the natural numbers by repeating the numbers instead of making up more numbers after 9 apples. Thus, the concept of digit came to existence with the number 10.

The numbers we got:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ... 19, 20, 21 ... 98, 99, 100, 101...
```

### Subtraction
Now let's go in reverse. We left 1 of 2 apples back. 1 apple left. Here we can represent the subtraction of 1 apple with negative numbers. Thus, we discovered **the inverse of a number with respect to the addition**.
```
2 - 1 = 1
2 + (-1) = 1
```

Now let's show them on the number line.
