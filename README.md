# Rediscovery of Math

# Numbers
Everything in mathematics is actually based on repetitive operations between 1 and 0. Just like the two sides of the coin, there are two numbers representing existence and non-existence, such as night and day, cold and hot.

## Addition and substraction

### Addition
Mathematics is the language of the universe. Let's take an example from nature.
- We don't have apples = 0 apples
- We have an apple = 1 apple
- We got 1 more apple from the tree. We need to define a concept for this apple group. We call this number 2.
- We bought 1 more apple, we said 3.
- 1 more apple, 1 more apple, 1 more apple... Our ancestors decided to advance the natural numbers by repeating the numbers instead of making up more numbers after 9 apples. Thus, the concept of digit came to existence with the number 10.

The numbers we got:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ... 19, 20, 21 ... 98, 99, 100, 101...
```

### Subtraction
Now let's go in reverse. We left 1 of 2 apples back. 1 apple left. Here we can represent the subtraction of 1 apple with negative numbers. Thus, we discovered **the inverse of a number with respect to the addition**.
```
2 - 1 = 1
2 + (-1) = 1
```

Now let's show them on the number line.
```
<--•--•--•--•--•-->
  -2 -1  0  1  2
```

## Multiplication & Division

### Multiplication
Multiplication notation (\*) is used to represent the repeated addition of the same number. The number obtained by repeating the operation returns **product**.
> Example from nature: let's collect 3 apples from each tree. By collecting 3 apples from 5 trees, we get a total of 15 apples.
```
3+3+3+3+3 = 3*5 = 15
0+3+3+3+3+3 = 3*5 = 15
```
The reason why the result obtained by multiplying a number by 0 is 0 is due to the ineffective element in the addition operation.

### Division & Remainder
The division (/) notation is used to represent the subtraction of a number by repeating the same number over and over. After subtracting as many numbers as possible up to 0, the concept of **remainder** for the number that cannot be subtracted any more is used. The number of repetitions gives the result of **division**.
> Example from nature: We want to distribute 9 apples equally to our 4 children. Since the division obtained from the division of 9 by 4 is 2, you can consume the remaining 1 apple as their father, after giving 2 apples to each child. :)
```
9-4-4=1 (no more 4 can be subtracted)
Since the process is repeated 2 times, the result of the division is 2
```

<details>
<summary>
But why can't a number be divisible by 0?
</summary>
This is where our first limitation comes into play. Because by constantly subtracting 0 from a number, 0 is not reached. It is described as UNDEFINED because it cannot be solved forever and the result cannot be reached when trying to do this operation.
Except for 0/0, this transaction is UNCERTAIN for now because it is a transaction where both rules overlap.
</details>

- The multiplication operation consists of repeating the addition operation,
- The division operation consists of repeating the subtraction operation.
Accordingly, we can say that multiplication and division are inversely related to each other.
Thus, we discovered **the inverse of a number for multiplication**.
```
6 / 2 = 3
6 * (1/2) = 3
```
