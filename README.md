# Rediscovery of Math

# Numbers
Everything in mathematics is actually based on repetitive operations between 1 and 0. Just like the two sides of the coin, there are two numbers representing existence and non-existence, such as night and day, cold and hot.

## Addition and substraction

### Addition
Mathematics is the language of the universe. Let's take an example from nature.
- We don't have apples = 0 apples
- We have an apple = 1 apple
- We got 1 more apple from the tree. We need to define a concept for this apple group. We call this number 2.
- We bought 1 more apple, we said 3.
- 1 more apple, 1 more apple, 1 more apple... Our ancestors decided to advance the natural numbers by repeating the numbers instead of making up more numbers after 9 apples. Thus, the concept of digit came to existence with the number 10.

The numbers we got:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ... 19, 20, 21 ... 98, 99, 100, 101...
```

### Subtraction
Now let's go in reverse. We left 1 of 2 apples back. 1 apple left. Here we can represent the subtraction of 1 apple with negative numbers. Thus, we discovered **the inverse of a number with respect to the addition**.
```
2 - 1 = 1
2 + (-1) = 1
```

Now let's show them on the number line.
```
<--•--•--•--•--•-->
  -2 -1  0  1  2
```

## Multiplication & Division

### Multiplication
Multiplication notation (\*) is used to represent the repeated addition of the same number. The number obtained by repeating the operation returns **product**.
> Example from nature: let's collect 3 apples from each tree. By collecting 3 apples from 5 trees, we get a total of 15 apples.
```
3+3+3+3+3 = 3*5 = 15
0+3+3+3+3+3 = 3*5 = 15
```
The reason why the result obtained by multiplying a number by 0 is 0 is due to the ineffective element in the addition operation.

### Division & Remainder
The division (/) notation is used to represent the subtraction of a number by repeating the same number over and over. After subtracting as many numbers as possible up to 0, the concept of **remainder** for the number that cannot be subtracted any more is used. The number of repetitions gives the result of **division**.
> Example from nature: We want to distribute 9 apples equally to our 4 children. Since the division obtained from the division of 9 by 4 is 2, you can consume the remaining 1 apple as their father, after giving 2 apples to each child. :)
```
9-4-4=1 (no more 4 can be subtracted)
Since the process is repeated 2 times, the result of the division is 2
```

<details>
<summary>
But why can't a number be divisible by 0?
</summary>
This is where our first limitation comes into play. Because by constantly subtracting 0 from a number, 0 is not reached. It is described as UNDEFINED because it cannot be solved forever and the result cannot be reached when trying to do this operation.
Except for 0/0, this transaction is UNCERTAIN for now because it is a transaction where both rules overlap.
</details>

- The multiplication operation consists of repeating the addition operation,
- The division operation consists of repeating the subtraction operation.
Accordingly, we can say that multiplication and division are inversely related to each other.
Thus, we discovered **the inverse of a number for multiplication**.
```
6 / 2 = 3
6 * (1/2) = 3
```

## Repetition by rule

### Summation
The sigma symbol (∑) is used to represent the repetition of a number up to a certain number in a certain rule.

<sub>n=1</sub>
∑ x
<sup>k=1</sup>
``` 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 ```

### Factorial
The factorial notation (!) is used to represent the repeated multiplication of a positive number by all numbers up to 1.

5!
```5*4*3*2*1 = 120 ```

## Exponentiation & Root & Logarithm

### Exponentiation
The exponent notation (^) is used to represent the repeated multiplication of the same number. The number of repetitions of the process returns **power**.
> Example from nature: Suppose 2 branches emerge from each branch in the tree. If this pattern is repeated 3 times, we can assume that there are 8 apples at the extremes.
```
        |          = 2^0 = 1
       / \         = 2^1 = 2
      /   \
     /     \
    /       \
   /\       /\     = 2^2 = 4
  /  \     /  \
 /\  /\   /\  /\
• • • •   • • • •  = 2^3 = 8
```
The reason why the result obtained with 0 power of a number is 1 is due to the ineffective element in the multiplication operation.

## Prime numbers
Many numbers are the product of smaller numbers. Minority prime numbers are the smallest building blocks of these products.
- Since the number 0 is the absorbing element in multiplication, we skip it.
- The number 1, on the other hand, does not have a distinguishing feature between numbers, as it is an ineffective element in multiplication.
- Numbers such as 2, 3 and 5 are prime numbers because they cannot be divided by numbers other than 1 and themselves.
- But the number 4 is not a prime because it is divisible by other numbers.
```1*4 = 2*2 = 4*1 = 4```
> Also another way we classify numbers is those that are multiples of 2 (even numbers) and those that aren't (odd numbers).

### Prime Divisors
We can divide a number into its prime divisors by dividing by repeating the prime numbers, respectively.
> Thanks to the obtained expression, we can find more efficient solutions to our real-life problems by calculating the **greatest common divisor** or **least common multiple** between two numbers.
In particular, it is one of the best methods we will use to reverse the exponentiation operation, which consists of repeating the multiplication operation.
